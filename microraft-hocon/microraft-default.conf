 # Duration of leader election rounds in milliseconds. If a candidate
 # cannot win majority votes before this timeout elapses, a new leader
 # election round is started. See "Section 5.2: Leader Election"
 # in the Raft paper.
 leader-election-timeout-millis: 1000

 # Duration in seconds for a follower to decide on failure of the current
 # leader and start a new leader election round. If this duration is too short,
 # a leader could be considered as failed unnecessarily in case of a small
 # hiccup. If it is too long, it takes longer to detect an actual failure.
 #
 # The Raft paper uses a single parameter, election timeout, to both detect
 # failure of the leader and perform a leader election round. A follower
 # decides the current leader to be crashed if the election timeout elapses
 # after the last received AppendEntriesRPC. Moreover, a candidate starts a new
 # leader election round if the election timeout elapses before it acquires
 # the majority votes or another candidate announces the leadership. The Raft
 # paper discusses the election timeout to be configured around 500
 # milliseconds. Even though such a low timeout value works just fine for
 # leader elections, we have experienced that it causes false positives for
 # failure detection of the leader when there is a hiccup in the system. When
 # a leader slows down temporarily for any reason, its followers may start
 # a new leader election round very quickly. To prevent such problems and allow
 # users to tune availability of the system with more granularity, MicroRaft
 # uses this parameter to detect failure of the leader.
 #
 # Please note that having 2 timeout parameters does not make any difference in
 # terms of the safety property. If both values are configured the same,
 # MicroRaft's behaviour becomes identical to the behaviour described
 # in the Raft paper.
 leader-heartbeat-timeout-secs: 10

 # Duration in seconds for a Raft leader node to send periodic heartbeat
 # requests to its followers in order to denote its liveliness. Periodic
 # heartbeat requests are actually append entries requests and can contain log
 # entries. A heartbeat request is not sent to a follower if an append entries
 # request has been sent to that follower recently.
 leader-heartbeat-period-secs: 2

 # Maximum number of uncommitted log entries in the leader's Raft log before
 # temporarily rejecting new requests of clients. This configuration enables
 # a back pressure mechanism to prevent OOME when a Raft leader cannot keep up
 # with the requests sent by the clients. When the "uncommitted log entries
 # buffer" whose capacity is specified with this configuration field is filled,
 # new requests fail with `CannotReplicateException` to slow down the clients.
 # You can configure this field by considering the degree of concurrency of
 # your clients.
 max-uncommitted-log-entry-count: 5000

 # In MicroRaft, a leader Raft node sends log entries to its followers in
 # batches to improve the throughput. This configuration parameter specifies
 # the maximum number of Raft log entries that can be sent as a batch in a
 # single append entries request.
 append-entries-request-batch-size: 1000

 # Number of new commits to initiate a new snapshot after the last snapshot
 # taken by a Raft node. This value must be configured wisely as it effects
 # performance of the system in multiple ways. If a small value is set, it
 # means that snapshots are taken too frequently and Raft nodes keep a very
 # short Raft log. If snapshot objects are large and the Raft state is
 # persisted to disk, this can create an unnecessary overhead on IO
 # performance. Moreover, a Raft leader can send too many snapshots to slow
 # followers which can create a network overhead. On the other hand, if a very
 # large value is set, it can create a memory overhead since Raft log entries
 # are going to be kept in memory until the next snapshot.
 commit-count-to-take-snapshot: 50000

 # MicroRaft's Raft log design ensures that every Raft node takes a snapshot at
 # exactly the same log index. This behaviour enables an optimization. When
 # a slowed down Raft follower falls far behind the Raft leader and needs to
 # install a snapshot, it transfers the snapshot chunks from both the Raft
 # leader and other followers in parallel. By this way, we utilize
 # the bandwidth of the followers to reduce the burden on the leader and speed
 # up the snapshot transfer process.

 # Denotes how frequently a Raft node publishes a report of its internal
 # Raft state. RaftNodeReport objects can be used for monitoring a running Raft
 # group.
