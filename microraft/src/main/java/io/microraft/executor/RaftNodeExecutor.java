 * The abstraction used by {@link RaftNode} to execute the Raft consensus
 * algorithm with the Actor model. You can read about the Actor Model at the
 * following link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model
 * <p>
 * A Raft node runs by submitting tasks to its Raft node executor. All tasks
 * submitted by a Raft node must be executed serially, with maintaining the
 * happens-before relationship, so that the Raft consensus algorithm and the
 * user-provided state machine logic could be executed without synchronization.
 * <p>
 * A default implementation, {@link DefaultRaftNodeExecutor} is provided and
 * should be suitable for most of the use-cases.
 * <p>
 * A {@link RaftNodeExecutor} implementation can implement
 * {@link RaftNodeLifecycleAware} to perform initialization and clean up work
 * during {@link RaftNode} startup and termination. However, there is one subtle
 * point about the order of method calls. {@link RaftNode} calls
 * {@link RaftNodeExecutor#execute(Runnable)} before
 * {@link RaftNodeLifecycleAware#onRaftNodeStart()} to submit the start task.
