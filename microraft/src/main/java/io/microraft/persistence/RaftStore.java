    /**
     * Persists the given snapshot chunk.
     * <p>
     * A snapshot is persisted with at least 1 chunk. The number of chunks in a
     * snapshot is provided via {@link SnapshotChunk#getSnapshotChunkCount()}. A
     * snapshot is considered to be complete when all of its chunks are provided to
     * this method in any order, and {@link #flush()} will be called afterwards.
     * <p>
     * After a snapshot is persisted at <em>index=i</em> and {@link #flush()} is
     * called, the log entry at <em>index=i</em>, all the preceding log entries, and
     * all the preceding snapshots are no longer needed and can be evicted from
     * storage. Failing to evict stale entries and snapshots do not cause a
     * consistency problem, but can increase the time to recover after a crash or
     * restart. Therefore eviction can be done in a background task.
     * <p>
     * MicroRaft takes snapshots at a predetermined interval, controlled by
     * {@link RaftConfig#getCommitCountToTakeSnapshot()}. For instance, if it is
     * 100, snapshots will occur at indices 100, 200, 300, and so on.
     * <p>
     * The snapshot index can lag behind the index of the highest log entry that was
     * already persisted and flushed, but there is an upper bound to this
     * difference, controlled by {@link RaftConfig#getMaxPendingLogEntryCount()}.
     * For instance, if it is 10, and a {@code persistSnapshot()} call is made with
     * <em>snapshotIndex=100</em>, the index of the preceding
     * {@code persistLogEntry()} call can be at most 110.

     * entry. This can happen when a Raft follower has fallen so far behind the
     * leader and the leader no longer holds the missing entries. In that case, the
     * follower receives a snapshot from the leader. There is no upper-bound on the
